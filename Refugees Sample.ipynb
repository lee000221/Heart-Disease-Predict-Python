In addition to dealing with uncertainties during their border crossing journeys, refugees also have to overcome challenges once they arrive in another country. Language barriers, cultural norms, social status, discrimination, and unemployment are just a few examples. With ongoing difficulties settling in a new country, refugees frequently experience major physical and mental issues prior to and during displacement (Byrow, Y., 2020).\n",

The main purpose of this tool is to provide the evidence base for response planning and support for persons of concern (PoCs). The tool utilizes the data analytic suite introduced by the proGres v4, a registration and case management system adopted by UNHCR. It uses historical population trend, mortality and fertility rates as inputs, and predict of the future refugee populate for a given region or country. The tool will apply a series of assumptions to produce reliable prediction of the future size and composition of PoC populations. Cohort-component method is being used as the projection methodology in this tool, and Bayesian methods were incorporated to quantify the uncertainty around projection estimates.

This research was conducted on three camps; two camps were given cash aid and one was given food aid. When refugee households and businesses inside the camps buy products and services from host-country enterprises outside the camps, economic spillovers occur (Taylor et al., 2016). Outside of the camps, the host country owns multiple production enterprises and retail companies. Based on the survey results, refugee households represent 5.5% of the total income of the three camps and 17.3% of companies outside the camps claim that refugees from the camps are their main purchasers (Taylor et al., 2016). Moreover, the rules governing contacts between refugees and the host country, the organization of host economic growth, and the features of refugees all influence the economic impact of refugees. Hence, positive output gain for providing refugees to interact with the host economy.\n",

        "* As the number of refugees increases so do the challenges to integrate them into host societies (Bansak et al., 2018). The authors have built a data-driven algorithm by combining supervised machine learning and optimal matching to assign refugees across resettlement locations for two countries which are the United States and Switzerland. Geographic context, personal qualities, and synergy between geography and human traits are three sets of factors that influence refugee acceptance within the resettlement locations (Bansak et al., 2018). By using available data, the algorithm is able to maximize the integration outcomes. The data was trained by using the refugees’ features, location resettlement, and employment rate to predict the expected employment success rate within refugees (Bansak et al., 2018). The results found an increase in the refugees’ employment rate in the majority of the resettlement location for both countries.\n",

        "The team presents a research done on discovering the patterns and trends of global refugee movements and to potentially increase public’s awareness on this matter. As well as to understand and analyze the impact of demographic factors such as age band and gender. The multifaceted nature of civil wars and the lack of systematic reports make it challenging to predict global refugee movements. However, with the availability of UNHCR data, it is possible to construct and analyze, patterns and trends of global refugee movements. <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tWhat are the impact of the demographic background (age band and gender) on the number of refugees worldwide?<br>\n",
        "We can observe the result in 5.7 and 5.8 that the gender female of age 5 till 11 have shown a rapid growth throughout the years. Moreover, runner-up is also dominated by females from the age range of 18 till 59. When females have financial, cultural, and social expectations that are not met in their home country, gender discrimination can be a major factor driving migration. Women's migration results differ depending on whether their journey is voluntarily or coerced, and whether their presence in the receiving nation is legal or not, just like any other migrant. However, when women work as migrant workers or engage in the labour market of the receiving culture, they develop independence, resulting in a shift in gender dynamics within their families. Gains of this sort at the household level, on the other hand, may or may not extend to other aspects of a woman's life, such as her place of employment or her ethnic group as a whole. Women who are migrants have a big advantage. They contribute to the economic growth of their destination nations via their knowledge expertise and abilities, and they contribute to the economic development of their home countries through earnings and enhanced experience when they return. <br>\n",
